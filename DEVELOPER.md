## Setup

### Prerequisite Software

- git
- [Docker and docker-compose](https://www.docker.com) for Mac or Windows or Linux (https://www.docker.com) 17.12.0 or later
- [NodeJS 10.14 or greater](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/)
- [yarn v1.9.4 or grater](https://yarnpkg.com)
- [Latest Flogo CLI (flogo-cli)](https://github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-cli)
  - The following will be necessary and they should be installed as part of installing the flogo-cli tool:
    - GO Lang v1.10 - Follow the instructions here https://golang.org/doc/install
    - [Go dep](https://golang.github.io/dep/)
    - Make sure you add $GOPATH/bin to your$PATH variable. Instructions related to the \$GOPATH variable are found in the above link in the ["Test your installation" section](https://golang.org/doc/install#testing)

### Getting the Sources

Make sure you have git access to the [flogo-web repository](https://github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-web.git) and clone it.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-web.git
```

### Getting the Service Images

The development environment depends on flogo services images (flow-service and state-service), if you have access to
TIBCO's reldocker or flogo's private dockerhub you can pull the images from them, otherwise you will need to build the images locally.

Chose and follow **one** of these methods to get the images:

1. Pull from dockerhub
1. Pull from TIBCO reldocker
1. Build the images locally

**METHOD 1: Pull from dockerhub**

In your terminal log into docker hub

```
docker login
```

After you authenticated in a terminal make sure you're in flogo-web's project root and run:

```sh
yarn run services:pull
```

**METHOD 2: Pull from TIBCO reldocker**

In your terminal login to reldocker using you LDAP credentials

```sh
docker login reldocker.tibco.com
```

After you authenticated, pull the images:

Pull and rename the state service image

```sh
docker pull reldocker.tibco.com/flogo/state-service:latest
docker tag reldocker.tibco.com/flogo/state-service:latest flogo/state-service:latest
```

Pull and rename the flow service image

```sh
docker pull reldocker.tibco.com/flogo/flow-service:latest
docker tag reldocker.tibco.com/flogo/flow-service:latest flogo/flow-service:latest
```

**METHOD 3: Build the images locally**

For this method you will need access to the [flogo-cicd repository](https://github.com/TIBCOSoftware/flogo-cicd).
Once you have access follow the instructions in flogo-cicd's readme using the private registry method
and build _only_ the following images (in the specified order, do not use the "build-all.sh" script):

1. flogo/go-builder
1. flogo/state-service
1. flogo/flow-service

Run `docker images` to make sure they were correctly built.

## Running the application locally

### Start the services

flow-services and state-service must be running in order to the test run a flow from the UI.

To start the services from the project root run:

```sh
yarn run services:start
```

### Before running the application

Make sure your local dependencies are up to date by running the following commands from the project root:

```sh
yarn install
yarn install:submodules
```

### Running the Application in Development Mode

Flogo Web development environment is composed of a client side application and a server side application. During development time
they run as two separate services and as such you will need two terminal windows to run them.

**Start the Server Application**

In terminal 1 go to flogo-web project root and run:

```sh
yarn start server
```

Server will start running. Please be patient if this is the first time you run the server app as it can take several
minutes to finish the startup process because it will need to create a Flogo engine instance and install the
default activities and triggers.

When you see the following banner in the console Flogo Web's server will be ready to respond:

```

 ======================================================
                 ___       __   __   __ TM
                |__  |    /  \ / _` /  \
                |    |___ \__/ \__| \__/

   [success] open http://localhost:3303 in your browser
  ======================================================

```

**Start the client application**

In a second terminal flogo-web project root and run:

```sh
yarn start client
```

Client application will start processing, once the processing progress reaches 100% you should see `ℹ ｢wdm｣: Compiled successfully` in the terminal and the app will be ready to be accessed in your browser.

## Running Tests Locally

### Before running the tests

Make sure your dependencies are up to date:

```sh
yarn install
```

### Running the tests

From the project root:

```sh
yarn test
```

This will run the unit test for all the sub packages i.e. server, client and parser.

### Running tests for a single subpackage

From the project root:

```sh
yarn test <name-of-the-package>
```

For example

```sh
yarn test server
```

## Customize the server environment

Before starting the server copy and rename the [`.env.example`](/.env.example) to `.env`. Add or modify/uncomment
the environment variables defined in created `.env` file.

You can alternatively set regular environment variables.

## Build the docker image for development

To build the development docker image locally, run the following command from the project root
(you can change the `:dev-build` tag to another name you prefer):

```bash
docker build -f tools/docker/dev.Dockerfile -t flogo/flogo-web:dev-build .
```

The building process will start, it might take several minutes depending on your machine resources. Once the build is finished
then you should be able to see the docker image listed when running `docker images`.

To start the container, run and navigate to `http://localhost:5033` once the container starts, note that you can change
the port `5033` in the command to a different port if needed:

```bash
docker run -it -p 5033:3303 flogo/flogo-web:dev-build
```

## Other tasks

All the commands listed in the following subsections are specified as `<command>: description` and they can be run from
the root of the project as:

```sh
yarn run <command>
```

For example: `yarn run services:status`

### Managing the services:

- `services:status`: Check services status (running, stopped, etc.)
- `services:pull`: Try to pull (download) newer versions of the services (Only availabe for dockerhub)
- `services:stop`: Stop the services
- `services:clear`: Warning: destructive. Remove all the service instances and cleanup all services database.

### Managing engine/local data

- `clean:local`: Clean ALL your local data. This will remove the engine, database and logs.
- `clean:engines`: Remove the local engines only. This will force the server to rebuild the engine on next startup.

### Misc

- `update-global-flogo`: Update global flogo-cli to the latest available

## Project architecture and advanced usage.

The Flogo Web project follows a monorepo approach and it is composed of multiple subpackages. These packages are located in two directories:

- `/libs`: Independent and reusable modules.
- `/apps`: Deployable apps which integrate and compose the modules and libs. Currently there are only two apps; backend (server) and client (frontend).

> :books: You might want to look at [some pros of conse of monorepos](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/doc/design/monorepo.md).

For this the project leverages [@angular/cli](https://cli.angular.io/) and [Nx](https://nrwl.io/nx/overview). It is advised for contributors of this project to become familiar with these tools so they can take advantage of their features such as code generation and dependency inspection.

Flogo Web uses npm/yarn scripts for its build process. Take a look at README.md of the packages as well as at the scripts section
in the `package.json` of the root project and the subpackages to find other commands available.

Project structure is following:

```
-- flogo-web (root package.json)
  |--- package.json (root package)
  |--- apps/
  |    |---- client/
  |    `---- server/
  `--- libs/
        |---- parser/
        `---- ...more libs
```
